### 1.1.1 

**A real example for needing a convex hull:** 

I think gerrymandering could use it because if a convex hull in 2D space contains all points you could find a border on a map that holds a bunch of houses that you want or certain groups of houses. Like if you had perfect information then you would want to make sure you had exactly 51% of the houses in each of the districts to be your houses aka a border that contains all these certain points 

### 1.1.2 
**What are the efficiency measures one could use in the real-world?**
- speed  
- space 
- which data structures you use 

### 1.1.3 
**What are the strengths and weaknesses of a data structure you've seen**

Well I am thinking about a heap if you always want your things sorted it is great for mins maxes but insertion and extraction are *`O`*`(log(n))` rather than *`O`*`(1)` so if you have something that always needs to be kind of sorted you can use a heap 

### 1.1.4 
**Consider the traveling salesman problem and the shortest distance problem - what are their similarities and differences?** 

They both would use a graph for their data structure most likely but for the shortest distance problem you only need to find the paths between 2 points it probably runs in something like *`O`*`(nlog(n))` but that might get raised to the power of the number of points so it gets out of hand quickly when you add more points 

### 1.1.5 
**Come up with 2 real world problems: one where only the exact solution is needed, one where an approximation would do:**

*Exact:* Matching users and their passwords - you have to make sure both are the same not just close

*Approximate:* The weather, like I want to know if it will be closer to 70 or 40 but I don't need it to be precise
