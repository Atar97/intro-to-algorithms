****

### 1.2.1
**Give an example of an application that needs algorithms. What algorithms are at play?**

Twitter they need to sort, search and relate a lot of different data. Tweets by time and hashtag etc.. 

### 1.2.2 
**at what value of *n* does `8`*`n`*`^2 < 64`*`n`*`lg(`*`n`*`)`?**

/ lg(a) = b <=> 2^b = a 

8lg(*n*) = *n*

under 44 8n^2 is faster 

### 1.2.3 
**for what n does 100n^2 run faster than 2^n** 

around n=14 2^n starts running slower
